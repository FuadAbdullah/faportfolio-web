# Fuad Abdullah's Portfolio Website

This project is currently underway to be my first ever portfolio website. The website is set to display details relevant to myself as a software engineer. There are plans to include a simple database to accept contact and recruitment messages by visitors to the website. After all, this website was meant for me to learn and apply Node.js framework and Express.js to control the behaviour of the website.
